[2]  Perhaps an easy method to compute the RNE for the Bayesian ES is to just ignore that it is a conditional mean. 
So, you can just use the vector of values (x% largest losses), X[i] (i=1,....,n ; with n "largest losses"), of which the estimated ES is the sample mean.  
There you can compute the Newey-West standard error in a regression of X[i] (i=1,....,n) on a constant. 
And you can compute stdev(X)/sqrt(n), which is the "regular" OLS standard error in a regression of X[i](i=1,....,n) on a constant.

Then the RNE of the naive Bayesian method is simply the ratio

(RNE of naive Bayesian method) = (regular OLS standard error)^2 / (Newey-West standard error)^2.

For the other approaches you can compute

(RNE of other method) = (RNE of naive Bayesian method) * (NSE of naive Bayesian method)^2  / (NSE of other method)^2

where these NSE's are "simply" computed as the sample standard deviation of 20 ES estimates. (That is the way the NSE is computed, isn't it?)


Does this make sense? Please tell if I overlook something here....


It is also fine if there are still question marks for the RNE of the Bayesian ES in the "draft of the draft".
